Here is a mermaid diagram to describe the classes to be used in the tic_tac_toe refactor.
The mermaid diagram was generated by claude, but modifications can be made for our purposes.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Game {
        -Board board
        -Player currentPlayer
        -Player[] players
        +startGame()
        +makeMove(int row, int col)
        +switchPlayer()
        +checkWinner() : Player
        +isGameOver() : bool
    }
    
    class Board {
        -char[][] grid
        +placeMark(int row, int col, char mark)
        +isCellEmpty(int row, int col) : bool
        +isFull() : bool
        +printBoard()
    }
    
    class Player {
        -String name
        -char mark
        +getName() : String
        +getMark() : char
    }
    
    Game "1" -- "1" Board
    Game "1" -- "2" Player
```

Since it is a simple command line game, We do not need 2 separate players, 
but can simply alternate the tokens used.
Overall this provides a good structure for the project.
